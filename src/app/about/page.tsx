            <p className="mb-2">
                For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by the power of touch and its ability to heal.
                In high school, I even envisioned myself as a massage therapist, creating a business name and logo
                for an assignment—Healing Hula Hands, inspired by my love of hula dancing.
                But as life unfolded, that dream was pushed aside.

            <p className="mb-2">
                Instead, I spent 17 years as a veterinary technician, dedicating myself to caring for animals.
                While I loved the work, something was always missing.
                I allowed fear to hold me back—fear of going back to school, fear of financial instability,
                and even fear of what others would think.
                My previous marriage made pursuing massage therapy impossible,
                as my ex-husband sexualized the profession and dismissed my passion. So, I let the dream fade into the background.

            <p className="mb-2">
                Then, life gave me a push. After being laid off for the second time post-COVID, I found myself at a crossroads.
                It was my daughter, Kaylee, who gave me the encouragement I needed.
                She reminded me that it was never too late to chase my dreams.
                With her support, and the support of my current husband, Jeff, I took a leap of faith.
                Now, here I am—42 years old and just four weeks away from graduating as a licensed massage therapist.
                I’ve found my passion again, and it’s stronger than ever.
                My focus is on orthopedic and sports massage, myofascial release, trigger point therapy, cupping, hot stones, aromatherapy, and prenatal massage. As I prepare to step into this new chapter, I’m exploring my options—whether to work in a clinic or spa or to start my own practice, Blissful Balance.

                Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that fear should never be the reason you don’t follow your dreams.
